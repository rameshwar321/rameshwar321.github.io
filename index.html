      <img src="images/writing.jpg" alt="Writing Image">
      <p>Good writing is not about big words — it's about <b>clear thinking</b>.</p>
      <p>Here are a few bold approaches that make your writing shine:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Clarity over complexity:</b> Always choose simple, direct language.</li>
        <li><b>Active voice:</b> “You can do this” is stronger than “This can be done.”</li>
        <li><b>Structure your thoughts:</b> One idea per paragraph keeps readers engaged.</li>
        <li><b>Edit without mercy:</b> Cut what doesn’t serve the main idea.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>✨ Writing improves when you <b>read more</b>, <b>think clearly</b>, and <b>rewrite often</b>.</p>
